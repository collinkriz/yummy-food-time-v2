    "name": "Hard Boiled Eggs",
    "ingredients": "6 to 12 large eggs",
    "directions": "Cover the eggs in a saucepan with water\n\nFill a saucepan about a quarter of the way with cold water. Place the eggs in a single layer at the bottom of the saucepan. Add more water so that the eggs are covered by at least an inch or two of water.\n\nThe more eggs that are crowding the pan the more water you should have over the eggs. 6 eggs should be covered by at least an inch, 7 to 12 eggs, 2 inches.\n\nHeat the pot on high heat and bring the water to a full rolling boil\n\nAdding a teaspoon of vinegar to the water may help keep egg whites from running out if an egg does crack while cooking. Also some people find adding 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the water helps prevent cracking as well as making the eggs easier to peel.\n\nTurn off the heat, keep the pan on the hot burner, cover, and let sit for 10-12 minutes\n\nIf you have the type of stove burner that doesn't retain heat when turned off, you might want to lower the temp to low, simmer for a minute, and then turn it off.\n\nDepending on how cooked you like your hard boiled eggs, the eggs should be done perfectly in 10-12 minutes. That said, depending on your altitude, the shape of the pan, the size of the eggs, the ratio of water to eggs, it can take a few minutes more.\n\nOr if you like your eggs not fully hard cooked, it can take a few minutes less. When you find a time that works for you, given your preferences, the types of eggs you buy, your pots, stove, and cooking environment, stick with it.\n\nIf I'm cooking a large batch of eggs, after 10 minutes I'll sacrifice one to check for doneness, by removing it with a spoon, running it under cold water, and cutting it open. If it's not done enough for my taste, I'll cook the other eggs a minute or two longer.\n\nI also find that it is very hard to overcook eggs using this method. I can let the eggs sit, covered, for up to 15-18 minutes without the eggs getting overcooked.\n\nStrain the water from the pan and run cold water over the eggs to cool them quickly and stop them from cooking further\n\nOr, if you are cooking a large batch of eggs, remove them with a slotted spoon to a large bowl of ice water.\n\nI find it easiest to peel the eggs under a bit of running water.\n\nThe best way to store hard boiled eggs is in a covered container in the refrigerator. Eggs can release odors in the fridge which is why it helps to keep them covered.\n\nThey should be eaten within 5 days.\n\nThe good thing about this method is that even if you forget and the eggs sit in the water a few minutes longer than you had planned, they'll still be fine.\n\nSome people like their eggs less or more hard cooked than others. If you want your eggs still a little translucent in the center, let them seep in the hot water for only 6 minutes or so.",

Melt butter with the oil until warmed. Add all the sliced onions. Toss them to coat in the butter and oil. Saut\u00e9, stirring rather frequently (every 3ish minutes) for about an hour until they are deep golden brown color and jammy. It\u2019s okay if a little is sticking to the bottom of the pot, but if it is excessive and they are burning, add a little bit more oil or even 1-2 tablespoon water.\n\nOnce the onions are caramelized, add the minced garlic and chopped thyme. Saut\u00e9 for about 3-4 minutes until very fragrant.\n\nPour the wine in and scrape the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon making sure to get up all the brown bits as it simmers and is absorbed / evaporated, about 1-2 minutes.\n\nFinish the caramelized onions by adding the worcestershire and salt.\n\nInto the same pot, add the beef broth, water, and dry uncooked pasta. Stir to combine and try to get as much pasta submerged as you can. Bring it up to a boil and then reduce to a simmer. Cook, stirring very frequently, until the pasta is al dente and a good amount of the liquid has evaporated \u2013 about 8-10 minutes. There will still be a bit of liquid, it\u2019ll continue to thicken as you add the cheese and cream.\n\nRemove the pot from the heat and add the heavy cream and shredded gruyere cheese. Mix together until fully incorporated and creamy.",

    "directions": "Toast bread. Melt butter in skillet. Toast bread on both sides. Set aside.\n\nPrep egg mixture. In a bowl, whisk the egg with salt and pepper. Add cabbage, carrots, and green onion. Mix well. The egg should completely coat the veggies.\n\nCook egg mixture. Heat a skillet and add egg mixture. Shape with a metal spatula into the shape of a square (the same size as the toast). Flip and cook on the other side.\n\nAdd sugar. Turn off the heat. Sprinkle sugar directly on top of the eggy filling.\n\nAdd ham and cheese. Add ham and cheese directly on top. If you prefer, briefly heat the ham on the skillet before transferring to the vegetable mixture.\n\nDrizzle Mayo and Ketchup and/or Sriracha. Be generous!\n\nAssemble sandwich. Transfer to buttered toast, adding more cabbage on top for freshness. Top with the remaining slice of bread. Cut in half and enjoy!\n\nMake egg mixture. In a large bowl, add egg, salt, and pepper. Whisk well with a fork. Add shredded cabbage, julienned carrot, and chopped green onion. Mix well until the egg coats all the veggies.\n\nToast bread. Heat skillet to medium heat. Melt 1 Tbsp butter and toast bread on one side. If needed, add 1 more Tbsp of butter and flip, toasting bread on other side. Set aside on a wire rack to cool slightly or tent bread against each other so the steam can escape.\n\nCook egg mixture. In the same skillet, carefully add eggy mixture in a square-ish mound about the same size as the bread. Using a metal spatula, shape the eggy filling into a square. Cook until the eggy edges look firm and the veggies have wilted a bit, about 3-4 minutes. Flip and cook until the mixture is completely cooked through, another 3-4 minutes. Lower heat to medium low, if the egg is burning or cooking too quickly.\n\nAdd sugar. Turn off the heat. Add 1-2 tsp sugar (to taste) directly over the cooked egg mixture.\n\nAdd ham and cheese. Add ham and cheese on top fo the cooked egg mixture. If you prefer, briefly heat the ham on the skillet before transferring to the vegetable mixture.\n\nAdd mayo and ketchup or sriracha. Be generous!\n\nAssemble. Make the sandwich, starting with one slice of buttered toasted bread then the egg mixture topped with ham and cheese. Add more cabbage on top, if desired, for added crunch and freshness. Top with remaining slice of bread. Cut in half and enjoy!\n\nVariations:\n\nMake it vegan. Leave out the ham and cheese. Swap out the egg with egg substitute and Kewpie mayo with vegan mayo. A complete plant-based meal.\n\nMake it sweeter. For a sweeter variation, add drizzles of sweetened condensed milk (from a can) instead of the mayonnaise.",
    "notes": "Make sure the egg mixture is fully cooked. Cook the egg mixture longer than you think \u2014 about 3-4 minutes per side over medium to medium-low heat. Look for the egg mixture to be fully cooked all the way to the middle, not just on the edges. Otherwise, it will be raw in the middle.\n\nAdd lots of veggies. My recipe uses a ratio of 1 large egg for 1.5 cup veggies. That\u2019s for 1 serving. But adjust the egg-to-vegetable ratio to your liking. The egg should barely hold all the vegetables together.\n\nFor 2+ servings, use a Grill Pan. This recipe easily duplicates. If cooking multiples, I recommend using a large, rectangular grill pan for faster cooking.",

    "name": "Italian Pasta Salad",
    "ingredients": "1 box (12 oz) tricolor rotini pasta\n1 cup chopped cucumber (peeled and seeded, about 1 cucumber)\n1 cup halved cherry or grape tomates\n1 cup crumbled feta cheese\n1 can (2.25 oz) sliced black olives drained\n1/4 cup finely diced red onion\n1/2 - 1 cup Italian salad dressing",
    "directions": "Cook pasta according to box instructions. Remember to salt your pasta water with 1-2 teaspoons of salt. When pasta is done, drain it and run cold water over it so the noodles can cool.\n\nIn a large mixing bowl, c\u00bdombine the cooked and cooled pasta, cucumber, tomatoes, feta cheese, olives, and red onion. Pour Italian dressing over it and stir together.\n\n*Start with 1/2 cup Italian dressing and go from there. I put about 3/4 cup dressing on the salad and then reserve the rest to add to the salad before serving to moisten it back up.\n\nCan be eaten right away or refrigerated for a few hours before serving.\n\n* I like it cold so I refrigerate for 2-4 hours before serving.",
    "notes": "Tip : This Italian pasta salad recipe is so versatile! If you like more pasta than go ahead and use more than the one box called for (of course you will probably have to add more dressing). If you prefer more olive or tomato, or even the red onion, then add more of that ingredient. I always add more feta cheese because I absolutely love feta cheese.\n\nItalian Dressing : Use an Italian dressing that you like. The flavor really comes through so use a good one. I highly recommend the Olive Garden Italian Dressing. It is the best tasting store-bought dressing I have found. Feel free to use a lite Italian salad dressing if you prefer.\n\nLeftovers : They keep well in a covered container in the fridge for several days (about 3-4 days). If you are making this salad the day ahead of when you need it, then be sure and stir it together and add slightly more dressing to moisten it all back up. As a pasta salad sits in the fridge the pasta will soak up the dressing which can dry out the salad a bit. But adding additional dressing will fix that problem. I prefer to make this salad the day of and let it refrigerate for about 2 hours before serving. I prefer a cold pasta salad but this salad can be eaten right away after making it.\n\nCucumbers : I like to use mini cucumbers, also called salad cucumbers, because they have hardly any seeds in them. So all I do is peel halfway (I like some green skin in the salad), cut in half lengthwise and then cut into small pieces. You can use regular cucumbers but they do have more water and seeds in them so be sure and take the seeds and pulpy stuff out of the middle before chopping. I use a metal table spoon and just slide it down the middle to remove all that stuff. You will be left with a crescent moon shape that you can chop small.",

Pre-shredded cheeses are coated in a starch that stops the cheese from melting as well as freshly grated cheese.

    "directions": "In a large pot, prepare the noodles per packaging instructions. Make sure to salt your pasta water! Drain and return to the pot.\n\nIn a medium sauce pan, brown the uncased sausage over medium heat while breaking it apart into small grounds with a spatula. Do this until cooked through, about 7-10 minutes. Remove the sausage from the pan and set aside, while preserving the sausage grease in the pan. (If you are OMITTING the sausage, you can skip this step and use 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil to saut\u00e9 the onion & pepper blend in instead.)\n\nOver medium-low heat in the same pan, add the diced onion and the banana peppers in the pan and saut\u00e9 for about 5-7 minutes until cooked through and translucent. Add the garlic and saut\u00e9 for about one minute, until fragrant.\n\nAdd the flour and stir for 1-2 minutes until well incorporated. Slowly stir in the heavy cream and milk, return the heat to medium, and bring to a light boil, stirring occasionally to prevent burning for 3-5 minutes, until thickened. Add the marinara sauce, stir well to incorporate, and let the sauce simmer for 10-15 minutes.\n\nAdd the cooked sausage to the palamino sauce and stir well to incorporate. Slowly pour 1/2 of the sauce over the pasta noods, and then add more as desired. I always like to spoon a little more sauce over the pasta once it\u2019s plated. Drizzle lightly with White Truffle Oil (I recommend this one from Old World Truffles) and finish the dish with a sprinkle of parmesan cheese. Enjoy!!",

Season with \u00bd teaspoon salt and some freshly ground black pepper, to taste.\n\nAssemble the enchiladas: Pour \u00bc cup enchilada sauce into your prepared pan and tilt it from side to side until the bottom of the pan is evenly coated. To assemble your first enchilada, spread \u00bd cup filling mixture down the middle of a tortilla, then snugly wrap the left side over and then the right, to make a wrap. Place it seam side down against the edge of your pan. Repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.\n\nDrizzle the remaining enchilada sauce evenly over the enchiladas, leaving the tips of the enchiladas bare. Sprinkle the remaining shredded cheese evenly over the enchiladas.\n\nBake, uncovered, on the middle rack for 20 minutes. If the cheese on top isn\u2019t golden enough for your liking, carefully transfer the enchiladas to the upper rack of the oven and bake for an additional 3 to 6 minutes, until sufficiently golden and bubbly.\n\nRemove from oven and let the enchiladas rest for 10 minutes (they\u2019re super hot!). Before serving, sprinkle chopped cilantro down the center of the enchiladas. Serve immediately.",

Working quickly and carefully, knead the dough, only incorporating as much flour as you need along the way until the dough loses stickiness and becomes more solid. Slice the dough into 4 parts. Roll out 1 part into a long rope, about 1 inch wide, cutting in half and working with 1 half at a time if the rope is becoming too long. Slice the rope into \u00bd-inch squares and set aside on a lightly floured surface.

Boil until they float to the surface; after another 15-30 seconds in the water, remove.\n\nIn a pan over medium heat, melt butter and add the sage.

    "directions": "Sauce\n\nCut open the dried chiles with scissors and remove the seeds. Add the chiles to a bowl with hot water to rehydrate, about 30 minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, place onions and garlic on a parchment paper lined baking tray and massage with 1 tablespoon vegetable oil. Place in the oven on the middle rack. Broil on high for about 25-30 minutes, or until the onions and garlic are darker in color and charred on the outer parts.\n\nWhen the chiles are rehydrated, drain them and place them in a blender with roasted onions, garlic, 1 cup broth, remaining 2 tablespoons of oil, and the seasonings. Blend until smooth. Transfer the sauce to a saucepan on medium high heat with the remaining 3 cups of broth and bay leaves. Bring to a boil. Once it reaches a boil, cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for an hour. Remove bay leaves with tongs, taste and adjust seasonings.\n\nBirria 'Meat'\n\nWhile the chiles are rehydrating and the onions & garlic are in the oven, start shredding your mushrooms using your hands. You can do this simultaneously, so that by the time you\u2019re done shredding your mushrooms, the peppers are rehydrated, and the onions & garlic are beautifully charred.\n\nOnce the mushrooms are shredded, season it with apple cider vinegar, oil, garlic powder, and salt. Give it a good massage to ensure all the pieces are coated. Cover it and let it marinate while the sauce is simmering.\n\nAfter the consomm\u00e9 has been simmering for an hour, it\u2019s time to cook your \u2018meat\u2019! While the sauce is still simmering, add a bit of oil to a large skillet on medium high heat. Once the oil is hot and shimmering, add marinated mushrooms in an even layer and cook until the edges begin to crisp up a bit, about 13-15 minutes. Once the mushrooms are crisped around the edges, add about 1.5 \u2013 2 cups of the sauce and cook, stirring often, another 5 minutes or so.\n\nTacos\n\nIn another pan on medium heat, add a bit more oil. Dip your corn tortilla into the sauce and place onto the pan \u2013 repeat with as many tortillas as will comfortably fit into the pan. Add a spoonful of cheese and a a couple tablespoons of the mushroom \u2018meat\u2019 onto one side of the tortilla. Cook until the bottom of the tortilla is lightly browned and crispy, about 1-2 minutes. Fold tacos in half, gently pressing with a spatula. Repeat the process with oil, sauce, tortillas, and remaining meat.\n\nServe tacos hot with onions, cilantro, fresh lime wedges, and additional sauce for dipping or sipping!",
    "notes": "My wife and I like the sauce a bit thick. Traditionally, it is served much thinner. If you prefer it thinned out, at more broth (about \u00bd cup at a time), until you reach the consistency you want.",

    "directions": "Prepare the teriyaki sauce.\n\nStart by preparing the teriyaki sauce and cornstarch slurry. Mix those well and set aside for now.\n\nYou can also chop up all your veggies: cut the carrots into matchsticks, chop the bell pepper and prepare the snap peas.\n\nMake the peanut sauce.\n\nAdd all of the ingredients to a mini food processor or blender and mix until smooth. Start with 2 tbsp of water then add more 1 tbsp at a time until you reach your desired consistency \u2013 you should be able to pour/drizzle it but it should still be somewhat thick and creamy.\n\nStir fry the veggies.\n\nHeat the sesame oil and water in a wok or skillet over medium heat and then add the chopped veggies and cover.\n\nCook for 4 minutes, then remove the lid and cook another 2-3 minutes until the veggies are tender but still bright and crisp.\n\nRemove the veggies from the pan, sprinkle with sesame seeds and set aside.\n\nMake the teriyaki chickpeas.\n\nThere should be enough oil left in the pan after cooking the veggies that you don\u2019t need more cooking liquid but if you do, add 1-2 tsp sesame oil or a splash of water.\n\nAdd the chickpeas and cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring often. Add the teriyaki sauce and stir to combine. Give the cornstarch slurry a good stir then pour it into the pan.\n\nCook, stirring often, until the teriyaki sauce thickens, this should just take a few minutes. Stir in the green onions.\n\nServe your bowls!\n\nDivide the rice between bowls, then top with a scoop of stir fried vegetables, teriyaki chickpeas and a drizzle of peanut sauce.\n\nFinish the bowls with a spinkle of sesame seeds and thinly sliced scallions, if desired. Sriracha optional!\n\nEXPERT TIPS\n\nDon\u2019t want to make the whole recipe? The teriyaki chickpeas are super easy to make and excellent on their own or added to any bowl, salad or just with rice to soak up all the yummy sauce.\n\nTo make teriyaki tofu, fry the tofu according to this recipe for sweet and sour tofu, then add the sauce and slurry and stir until thickened.\n\nTo make a teriyaki stir fry, stir fry your veggies until tender then add the sauce and stir until thickened.\n\nTo just make the sauce, heat in a small sauce pan until thick and sticky. This can be used as a dip or drizzled over rice.\n\nYou can mix and match the amount of carrot, snap pea and bell pepper or try other veggies like broccoli, zucchini or mushroom. I recommend keeping it to 3-4 different vegetables, whichever you choose.\n\nMAKING AHEAD & STORING\n\nIf making in advance, I recommending storing the peanut sauce separately until just before serving. You don\u2019t have to do this but I find if you add it before storing, it just gets soaked up and you can\u2019t really taste it.\n\nAssembled bowls will store in the fridge for up to 4 days.\n\nReheat leftover bowls in the microwave until heated through. You could also dump everything in a pan and stir fry to reheat if you don\u2019t have a microwave.\n\nCook Rice: If you don\u2019t have cooked rice on hand, start cooking your choice of rice now according to package instructions. Recommended to use 1/2-1 cup cooked rice per bowl but you can adjust that to your preference/nutritional needs.\n\nMake the Teriyaki Sauce: In a small bowl, combine tamari, maple syrup, vinegar, mirin, ginger and garlic.\n\nMake Cornstarch Slurry: In another small bowl, whisk together the water and cornstarch.\n\nMake the Ginger Peanut Sauce: Use a small blender or mini food processor to blend all of the ingredients until smooth, or combine in a bowl and whisk until smooth. Start with 2 tbsp water and slowly add more until you reach your desired consistency. It should be thick and creamy but pourable.\n\nStir Fry the Vegetables: In a large wok or skillet, heat 2 tsp sesame oil and 2 tbsp water over medium heat. When the pan is hot, add the carrots, snap peas and peppers. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and cook for 4 min. Uncover and cook for another 2-3 min, stirring occasionally, until tender-crisp.\n\nCook the Chickpeas: In the same pan, heat 2 tsp oil over medium-high heat (you may not need extra oil after cooking the veggies). Add the chickpeas. Cook for 2-3 min, stirring occasionally until golden-brown. Add the teriyaki sauce and mix well to coat the chickpeas.\n\nAdd Cornstarch: Stir the cornstarch slurry then add it to the pan. Cook for 3-4 min, stirring often, until thickened.\n\nAdd Green Onions: Stir in the green onions.\n\nServe: Divide rice between bowls. Top with the veggies and chickpeas. Drizzle ginger-peanut sauce over top. Sprinkle with sesame seeds and green onions.",
    "notes": "Note : If you don\u2019t have a blender, you can mix it in a bowl with a whisk, though there will be little pieces of garlic and ginger, unless you substitute ground garlic and ginger.\n\nConsider doubling the sauce recipe and using the extra for rice, stir fry, tofu, veggies, etc.\n\nNote: You can make the veggies first then use the same pan for the teriyaki chickpeas or, you can make both at the same time in different pans. It\u2019s up to you!\n\nI made the veggies first then cooked the chickpeas after in the same pan, in order to save cleaning an extra dish.",

    "name": "Instant Pot Chicken Shawarma",
    "ingredients": "Chicken Shawarma\n\u00bd cup olive oil\n\u00bc cup lemon juice from 2 lemons\n2 teaspoon smoked paprika\n\u00bd teaspoon tumeric\n2 teaspoon cumin powder\n\u00bd teaspoon cinnamon\n1 teaspoon red pepper flakes\n4 cloves garlic minced\n2 teaspoon black pepper\n1 teaspoon salt\n1 large onion sliced\n4 pounds chicken thighs boneless and skinless\n2 tablespoon parsley fresh, for garnish\n1 tablespoon olive oil\nGarlic Sauce\n1 cup vegetable oil\n\u2153 cup lemon juice\n6 cloves garlic peeled and roughly chopped\n1 egg white *\n1 teaspoon salt\nChicken Shawarma Wraps\nhummus\ngreek salad\ngarlic sauce\nchicken\npita wraps",
    "directions": "Chicken Shawarma\n\nAdd the olive oil, lemon juice, paprika, turmeric, cumin, cinnamon, red pepper flakes, garlic, pepper, salt and onions to a ziploc bag, then add the chicken thighs. Seal the bag and shake it well to mix the ingredients. Place the bag in the refrigerator and marinate for at least 1 hour. The flavours develop better the longer you leave them.\n\nTransfer the chicken into your Instant Pot. Mix to ensure even coverage. Close the lid (follow the manufacturer\u2019s guide for instructions on how to close the instant pot lid). Set the Instant Pot to the Manual setting and set the timer to 8 minutes on high pressure.\n\nOnce the Instant Pot cycle is complete, wait until the natural release cycle is complete, should take about 15 minutes. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s guide for quick release, if in a rush. Carefully unlock and remove the lid from the instant pot. Remove the chicken using a slotted spoon.\n\nHeat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken thighs to the skillet and sear them for about 1 to 2 minutes per side just until they start to brown. You may have to do this in a couple batches. This step is optional if you want to get a crispier chicken.\n\nGarlic Sauce\n\nAdd all the ingredients to a blender and blend until smooth, about 1-2 minutes. Refrigerate leftover sauce.\n\nChicken Shawarma Wraps\n\nTo assemble the chicken shawarma wraps, warm up the pitas for 20 seconds to soften them. Spread a tbsp each of garlic sauce and hummus over the middle of the pita. Top with chicken, greek salad, garnish with parsley, and more sauce if desired.\n\nYou can also omit the raw egg white, just add the oil little by little to the blender until it thickens and should have the consistency of mayonnaise.\n\nTotal time include time required to marinate the chicken and the time required for the Instant pot to start and release pressure.",
    "notes": "Note: In the video I forgot to add the onion to the marinade, so we ended up caramelizing some onion in some of the liquid left in the instant pot after the chicken was done.\n\nChicken breast can also be used instead of the thighs with the same cooking time.",

    "directions": "Cut three-quarters of the salmon into 1/4-inch pieces. Put in a large bowl. Cut the rest of the salmon into chunks; transfer the chunks to a food processor along with the mustard, mayonnaise, lemon juice, lemon zest and cayenne. Pulse to make a paste. Add the pureed salmon mixture to the bowl with the diced salmon. Add the scallions, 2 tablespoons panko, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and black pepper to taste. Gently mix until just combined.\n\nLine a baking sheet with parchment paper and brush with olive oil. Divide the salmon mixture into 4 mounds on the parchment paper. With damp hands, pat into 4-inch-wide, 3/4-inch-thick patties. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes.\n\nPreheat the broiler. Spread the remaining 1 cup panko on a plate. Press both sides of the salmon patties in the panko. Heat the olive oil in a large nonstick or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the patties (in batches if necessary) and cook until browned on the bottom, 3 to 4 minutes, adjusting the heat if necessary. Turn and cook until the other side is browned and the patties feel springy in the center, 3 to 4 more minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain; season with salt.\n\nMeanwhile, arrange the buns, cut-side up, on a broiler pan and broil until toasted, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve the patties on the buns; top with tartar sauce and arugula.",

    "directions": "BEFORE YOU START\n\nPreheat the oven to 425\u00b0. Let the oven preheat completely. It is best for the oven to come to temperature 5-10 minutes before putting anything in it.\n\nGrated the butter with a box or hand grater.\n\nWhile you prepare the other ingredients, leave the grated butter in the freezer, so it stays cold.\n\nReview all recipe notes and instructions before beginning.\n\nPreheat the oven to 425\u00b0. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\n\nIn a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt.\n\nIn a separate bowl, whisk together the water, honey, and vinegar.\n\nAdd the butter to the dry ingredients and stir until well combined.\n\nPour about half of the water mixture over the butter and dry ingredients. Stir gently.\n\nAdd the rest of the water mixture. Continue stirring just until the dough comes together.\n\nDrop about 2 heaping Tablespoons of dough onto the baking sheet to form about 15 biscuits (3 x 5).\n\nBake for 16-18 minutes or until the tops begin to turn golden brown. Brush with additional melted butter or honey butter before serving.",
    "notes": "Honey: Swap honey for 1 Tablespoon of white or brown sugar.\n\nWhite Vinegar: Swap for lemon juice or omit. However, it does add more depth to the flavor, mimicking the tang of buttermilk.\n\nGrated Butter: After the butter has chilled, use a box or hand grater to grate the butter. I do half of the butter with the finer blade and half with the larger blade creating a variety of sizes.\n\nHoney Butter: Simply mix the melted butter and honey together in a small bowl. Brush over the top of the warm biscuits.\n\nWork quickly. You want the butter and water to stay as cold as possible so the biscuits come out super fluffy. These are drop biscuits so do not spend too much time forming them. You can see in the photo above that mine are not super uniform.\n\nDon't over mix! Once the biscuit dough comes together, stop mixing.\n\nWhile you prepare the other ingredients, leave the grated butter in the freezer, so it stays cold.\n\nThe mixture will be sticky. If the mixture seems extremely wet, add another tablespoon of flour.\n\nDon't over bake! Once the tops just start to brown, remove them from the oven.",
