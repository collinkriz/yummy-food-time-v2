    "name": "Hard Boiled Eggs",
    "ingredients": "6 to 12 large eggs, straight from the fridge",
    "directions": "1. Add the eggs to a saucepan and cover with water: Fill a saucepan about a quarter of the way with cold water. Place the eggs in a single layer at the bottom of the saucepan. Add more water so that the eggs are covered by at least an inch or two of water. The more eggs that are crowding the pan the more water you should have over the eggs. 6 eggs should be covered by at least an inch, 7 to 12 eggs, 2 inches. Tip: Adding a teaspoon of vinegar to the water may help keep egg whites from running out if an egg does crack while cooking. Some people also find adding 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the water helps prevent cracking as well as making the eggs easier to peel. If desired, add either or both of these ingredients as the water begins to boil.\n\n2. Bring to a rolling boil: Leave the pan uncovered. Turn the heat to high and bring the water to a rolling boil.\n\n3. Turn off the heat, cover, and let sit: Depending on how cooked you like your hard boiled eggs, the eggs should be done perfectly after sitting for 10-12 minutes. That said, depending on your altitude, the shape of the pan, the size of the eggs, and the ratio of water to eggs, it can take a few minutes more. Or if you like your eggs not fully hard cooked, it can take a few minutes less. When you find a time that works for you given your preferences, the types of eggs you buy, your pots, stove, and cooking environment, stick with it. I also find that it is very hard to overcook eggs using this method. I can let the eggs sit, covered, for up to 15-18 minutes without the eggs getting overcooked. Tip: If I'm cooking a large batch of eggs, after 10 minutes I'll sacrifice one to check for doneness, by removing it with a spoon, running it under cold water, and cutting it open. If it's not done enough for my taste, I'll cook the other eggs a minute or two longer.\n\n4. Strain and run under cold water: Strain the hot water from the pan, careful not to dump out the eggs, and run cold water over them until they are cool to the touch. This will stop the eggs from cooking further and make them easier to peel. Or, if you are cooking a large batch of eggs, remove them with a slotted spoon to a large bowl of ice water. Let them sit for a few minutes, or until cooled.\n\n5. Peel or store for later: I find it easiest to peel the eggs under a bit of running water. The best way to store hard boiled eggs is unpeeled in a covered container in the refrigerator. Eggs can release odors in the fridge which is why it helps to keep them covered. They should be eaten within 5 days. Peeled eggs should be eaten within a day or two.",

Saut\u00e9 for about 3-4 minutes until very fragrant.\n\nPour the wine in and scrape the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon making sure to get up all the brown bits as it simmers and is absorbed / evaporated, about 1-2 minutes. Finish the caramelized onions by adding the worcestershire, salt, and pepper.\n\nInto the same pot, add the beef broth, water, and dry uncooked pasta. Stir to combine and try to get as much pasta submerged as you can. Bring it up to a boil and then reduce to a simmer. Cook, stirring very frequently, until the pasta is al dente and a good amount of the liquid has evaporated \u2013 about 8-10 minutes. There will still be a bit of liquid, it'll continue to thicken as you add the cheese and cream.\n\nRemove the pot from the heat and add the heavy cream and shredded gruyere cheese.

    "ingredients": "Toasted Bread:\n2 thick slices milk bread (Japanese Milk Bread preferred but Texas style toast also works, as well as regular white or multi-grain sandwich bread)\n1-2 Tbsp unsalted butter\n\nEggy Filling:\n1 large egg preferably organic\nsalt + pepper\n1 cup cabbage, thinly sliced (preferably Korean cabbage but green cabbage or savoy also works)\n1/2 cup carrot, grated or julienned\n1 green onion, chopped\n\nAdditional Toppings:\n1-2 tsp sugar (to taste)\n1-2 slices ham\n1 slice cheddar cheese\n1/4 cup cabbage, shredded (optional)\ndrizzle mayonnaise (I use Kewpie mayo)\ndrizzle Sriracha (optional; ketchup is a good non-spicy substitute)",
    "directions": "Make egg mixture. In a large bowl, add egg, salt, and pepper. Whisk well with a fork. Add shredded cabbage, julienned carrot, and chopped green onion. Mix well until the egg coats all the veggies.\n\nToast bread. Heat skillet to medium heat. Melt 1 Tbsp butter and toast bread on one side. If needed, add 1 more Tbsp of butter and flip, toasting bread on other side. Set aside on a wire rack to cool slightly or tent bread against each other so the steam can escape.\n\nCook egg mixture. In the same skillet, carefully add eggy mixture in a square-ish mound about the same size as the bread. Using a metal spatula, shape the eggy filling into a square. Cook until the eggy edges look firm and the veggies have wilted a bit, about 3-4 minutes. Flip and cook until the mixture is completely cooked through, another 3-4 minutes. Lower heat to medium low, if the egg is burning or cooking too quickly.\n\nAdd sugar. Turn off the heat. Add 1-2 tsp sugar (to taste) directly over the cooked egg mixture.\n\nAdd ham and cheese. Add ham and cheese on top fo the cooked egg mixture. If you prefer, briefly heat the ham on the skillet before transferring to the vegetable mixture. Add mayo and ketchup or sriracha. Be generous!\n\nAssemble. Make the sandwich, starting with one slice of buttered toasted bread then the egg mixture topped with ham and cheese. Add more cabbage on top, if desired, for added crunch and freshness. Top with remaining slice of bread. Cut in half and enjoy!",
    "notes": "Make sure the egg mixture is fully cooked. Cook the egg mixture longer than you think \u2014 about 3-4 minutes per side over medium to medium-low heat. Look for the egg mixture to be fully cooked all the way to the middle, not just on the edges. Otherwise, it will be raw in the middle.\n\nAdd lots of veggies. My recipe uses a ratio of 1 large egg for 1.5 cup veggies. That\u2019s for 1 serving. But adjust the egg-to-vegetable ratio to your liking. The egg should barely hold all the vegetables together.\n\nFor 2+ servings, use a Grill Pan. This recipe easily duplicates. If cooking multiples, I recommend using a large, rectangular grill pan for faster cooking.",

    "notes": "As cheese that is freshly shredded melts the best, you may want to avoid pre-shredded cheese which contains stabilizers.\n\nKeep in mind also, that this a thick, creamy soup, and will likely be best if reheated on the stove.\n\nIf you do not like to use wine in your cooking, simply omit it and skip that step, instead going directly to adding the stock-the soup will still be delicious!\n\nFor a vegetarian soup, use vegetable stock in place of chicken stock!",

    "name": "Italian Pasta Salad",
    "ingredients": "1 box (12 oz) tricolor rotini pasta\n1 cup chopped cucumber (peeled and seeded, about 1 cucumber)\n1 cup halved cherry or grape tomatoes\n1 cup crumbled feta cheese\n1 can (2.25 oz) sliced black olives drained\n1/4 cup finely diced red onion\n1/2 - 1 cup Italian salad dressing",
    "directions": "Cook pasta according to box instructions. Remember to salt your pasta water with 1-2 teaspoons of salt. When pasta is done, drain it and run cold water over it so the noodles can cool. In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooked and cooled pasta, cucumber, tomatoes, feta cheese, olives, and red onion. Pour Italian dressing over it and stir together. Start with 1/2 cup Italian dressing and go from there. I put about 3/4 cup dressing on the salad and then reserve the rest to add to the salad before serving to moisten it back up. Can be eaten right away or refrigerated for a few hours before serving. I like it cold so I refrigerate for 2-4 hours before serving.",
    "notes": "Tip : This Italian pasta salad recipe is so versatile! If you like more pasta than go ahead and use more than the one box called for (of course you will probably have to add more dressing). If you prefer more olive or tomato, or even the red onion, then add more of that ingredient. I always add more feta cheese because I absolutely love feta cheese.\n\nItalian Dressing : Use an Italian dressing that you like. The flavor really comes through so use a good one. I highly recommend the Olive Garden Italian Dressing. It is the best tasting store-bought dressing I have found. Feel free to use a lite Italian salad dressing if you prefer.\n\nLeftovers : They keep well in a covered container in the fridge for several days (about 3-4 days). If you are making this salad the day ahead of when you need it, then be sure and stir it together and add slightly more dressing to moisten it all back up. As a pasta salad sits in the fridge the pasta will soak up the dressing which can dry out the salad a bit. But adding additional dressing will fix that problem. I prefer to make this salad the day of and let it refrigerate for about 2 hours before serving. I prefer a cold pasta salad but this salad can be eaten right away after making it.\n\nCucumbers : I like to use mini cucumbers, also called salad cucumbers, because they have hardly any seeds in them. So all I do is peel halfway (I like some green skin in the salad), cut in half lengthwise and then cut into small pieces. You can use regular cucumbers but they do have more water and seeds in them so be sure and take the seeds and pulpy stuff out of the middle before chopping. I use a metal table spoon and just slide it down the middle to remove all that stuff. You will be left with a crescent moon shape that you can chop small.",

    "notes": "*Whole milk is the best for this recipe, because the sauce will thicken faster. 2% will also work, but it will take a little longer to thicken. The batch in the photos was made with 2%.\n\n**It's so important to use freshly grated cheese. Pre-shredded cheeses are coated in a starch that stops the cheese from melting as well as freshly grated cheese. That means that you won't get those ultra delicious and remarkably cheesy bites if you use pre-shredded cheese.",

    "directions": "In a large pot, prepare the noodles per packaging instructions. Make sure to salt your pasta water! Drain and return to the pot.\n\nIn a medium sauce pan, brown the uncased sausage over medium heat while breaking it apart into small grounds with a spatula. Do this until cooked through, about 7-10 minutes. Remove the sausage from the pan and set aside, while preserving the sausage grease in the pan. (If you are OMITTING the sausage, you can skip this step and use 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil to saut\u00e9 the onion & pepper blend in instead.)\n\nOver medium-low heat in the same pan, add the diced onion and the banana peppers in the pan and saut\u00e9 for about 5-7 minutes until cooked through and translucent. Add the garlic and saut\u00e9 for about one minute, until fragrant.\n\nAdd the flour and stir for 1-2 minutes until well incorporated. Slowly stir in the heavy cream and milk, return the heat to medium, and bring to a light boil, stirring occasionally to prevent burning for 3-5 minutes, until thickened. Add the marinara sauce, stir well to incorporate, and let the sauce simmer for 10-15 minutes.\n\nAdd the cooked sausage to the palamino sauce and stir well to incorporate. Slowly pour 1/2 of the sauce over the pasta noods, and then add more as desired. I always like to spoon a little more sauce over the pasta once it\u2019s plated. Drizzle lightly with White Truffle Oil (I recommend this one from Old World Truffles) and finish the dish with a sprinkle of parmesan cheese. Enjoy!!",

Assemble the enchiladas: Pour \u00bc cup enchilada sauce into your prepared pan and tilt it from side to side until the bottom of the pan is evenly coated. To assemble your first enchilada, spread \u00bd cup filling mixture down the middle of a tortilla, then snugly wrap the left side over and then the right, to make a wrap. Place it seam-side down against the edge of your pan. Repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.\n\n6. Drizzle the remaining enchilada sauce evenly over the enchiladas, leaving the tips of the enchiladas bare. Sprinkle the remaining shredded cheese evenly over the enchiladas.\n\n7. Bake, uncovered, on the middle rack for 20 minutes. If the cheese on top isn't golden enough for your liking, carefully transfer the enchiladas to the upper rack of the oven and bake for an additional 3 to 6 minutes, until sufficiently golden and bubbly.\n\n8. Remove from oven and let the enchiladas rest for 10 minutes (they're super hot!). Before serving, sprinkle chopped cilantro down the center of the enchiladas. Serve immediately. Leftovers will keep well for up to 4 days in the refrigerator, covered.",

Season to taste with salt. Remove and discard the cobs. Line a strainer with cheesecloth and set it over a bowl. Strain the broth and measure out 5 cups. Freeze any leftover broth.\n\nStep 3: Heat the oil over medium heat in a heavy soup pot and add the onion. Cook, stirring, until it is tender, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds, and then add the 4 cups of corn kernels and salt to taste. Cook, stirring often, for 4 to 5 minutes, until the corn is just tender. Add the corn broth and bring to a simmer. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes.\n\nStep 4: Meanwhile roast the chilies, either directly over a gas flame or under a broiler, turning often until they are uniformly charred. Transfer to a plastic bag and seal, or transfer to a bowl and cover tightly. Allow the peppers to cool, then remove the charred skin, rinse and pat dry. Remove the seeds and veins (I recommend that you wear plastic gloves for this) and cut in thin strips or dice.\n\nStep 5: Steam the kernels set aside for the garnish for 5 minutes, until tender. Set aside.\n\nStep 6: Working in batches, pur\u00e9e the soup in a blender, taking care to remove the insert from the top and cover tightly with a kitchen towel to avoid splashes. Return to the heat, taste and adjust salt, and heat through.\n\nStep 7: Ladle the soup into bowls. Combine the steamed corn kernels and diced chilies and place a spoonful in the middle of each bowl of soup. Garnish with a sprinkling of cilantro or chives if desired, and serve.",

Set aside for 30 minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, in a small bowl, mix together the soy sauce, oyster sauce, red chili paste, fish sauce, and granulated sugar. Set aside.\n\nUsing your hands, crumble the tofu into a medium bowl. Add cornstarch and toss until evenly coated. Heat a thin layer of oil in a large wok or skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the tofu and cook until browned and crispy all over, turning and breaking up the pieces with a wooden spoon as it cooks. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the tofu to a plate.\n\nAdd more oil to the pan, if necessary, and briefly saut\u00e9 the carrot and bell pepper until slightly softened, about 3 minutes. Set aside with the tofu.\n\nAdd the garlic and the white parts of the green onion to the pan and saute until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in the sauce mixture Cook until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 2 minutes. If you're having trouble getting the sauce to reach a good consistency, mix 1 tablespoon of cornstarch with 1 tablespoon cold water to form a slurry and mix it into the sauce, then continue to cook until thickened. Add the boiled noodles to the pan, as well as the prepared tofu and vegetables. Stir until well-coated. Sprinkle with chili oil or chili flakes, if desired, for extra heat. Serve topped with the green parts of the green onion, cilantro, and sesame seeds.",

Working quickly and carefully, knead the dough, only incorporating as much flour as you need along the way until the dough loses stickiness and becomes more solid. Slice the dough into 4 portions. Roll out 1 portion into a long rope, about 1 inch wide, cutting in half and working with 1 half at a time if the rope is becoming too long. Slice the rope into \u00bd-inch pieces and set aside on a lightly floured surface. Repeat with the remaining dough.\n\nIf desired, place a fork on your work surface and slide each gnocchi square from the base of the fork prongs to the top to make a decorative pattern, or press your indent finger into the center of each square to make a divot.\n\nBring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the gnocchi in batches, stirring gently once or twice to ensure they are not sticking. Boil until they float to the surface; after another 15-30 seconds in the water, remove.\n\nMelt the butter in a large pan over medium heat. Add the sage and cook until starting to crisp, 46\u201360 seconds, then add the gnocchi and toss until lightly golden.\n\nEnjoy!",

    "ingredients": "Sauce:\n3 dried California Chiles\n3 dried chile de arbol, optional\n2 dried guajillo chiles\n1 dried pasilla chile\n1 large white onion, quartered\n6 cloves garlic\n3 TBS vegetable oil, divided\n4 cups prepared vegan chicken or vegetable broth, divided\n3 whole peppercorns, or \u00bd tsp ground black pepper\n3 whole cloves\n1 tsp whole cumin\n1 tsp dried oregano\n\u00bc tsp ground cinnamon\n\u215b tsp allspice\n3 Bay leaves\n\nBirria 'Meat':\n2 LBS oyster mushrooms\n2 TBS apple cider vinegar\n2 TBS vegetable oil\n2 tsp garlic powder\n1 tsp Kosher salt\n\nTacos:\n12 corn tortillas\n1 cup vegan mozzarella shreds\nChopped cilantro, for serving\nDice onion, for serving\nLime wedges, for serving",
    "directions": "Sauce:\nCut open the dried chiles with scissors and remove the seeds. Add the chiles to a bowl with hot water to rehydrate, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, place onions and garlic on a parchment paper lined baking tray and massage with 1 tablespoon vegetable oil. Place in the oven on the middle rack. Broil on high for about 25-30 minutes, or until the onions and garlic are darker in color and charred on the outer parts. When the chiles are rehydrated, drain them and place them in a blender with roasted onions, garlic, 1 cup broth, remaining 2 tablespoons of oil, and the seasonings. Blend until smooth. Transfer the sauce to a saucepan on medium high heat with the remaining 3 cups of broth and bay leaves. Bring to a boil. Once it reaches a boil, cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for an hour. Remove bay leaves with tongs, taste and adjust seasonings.\n\nBirria 'Meat':\nWhile the chiles are rehydrating and the onions & garlic are in the oven, start shredding your mushrooms using your hands. You can do this simultaneously, so that by the time you're done shredding your mushrooms, the peppers are rehydrated, and the onions & garlic are beautifully charred. Once the mushrooms are shredded, season it with apple cider vinegar, oil, garlic powder, and salt. Give it a good massage to ensure all the pieces are coated. Cover it and let it marinate while the sauce is simmering. After the consomm\u00e9 has been simmering for an hour, it's time to cook your 'meat'! While the sauce is still simmering, add a bit of oil to a large skillet on medium high heat. Once the oil is hot and shimmering, add marinated mushrooms in an even layer and cook until the edges begin to crisp up a bit, about 13-15 minutes. Once the mushrooms are crisped around the edges, add about 1.5 \u2013 2 cups of the sauce and cook, stirring often, another 5 minutes or so.\n\nTacos:\nIn another pan on medium heat, add a bit more oil. Dip your corn tortilla into the sauce and place onto the pan \u2013 repeat with as many tortillas as will comfortably fit into the pan. Add a spoonful of cheese and a a couple tablespoons of the mushroom 'meat' onto one side of the tortilla. Cook until the bottom of the tortilla is lightly browned and crispy, about 1-2 minutes. Fold tacos in half, gently pressing with a spatula. Repeat the process with oil, sauce, tortillas, and remaining meat. Serve tacos hot with onions, cilantro, fresh lime wedges, and additional sauce for dipping or sipping!",
    "notes": "My wife and I like the sauce a bit thick. Traditionally, it is served much thinner. If you prefer it thinned out, at more broth (about \u00bd cup at a time), until you reach the consistency you want.",

Set the Instant Pot to the Manual setting and set the timer to 8 minutes on high pressure.\n3. Once the Instant Pot cycle is complete, wait until the natural release cycle is complete, should take about 15 minutes. Follow the manufacturer's guide for quick release, if in a rush. Carefully unlock and remove the lid from the instant pot. Remove the chicken using a slotted spoon.\n4. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken thighs to the skillet and sear them for about 1 to 2 minutes per side just until they start to brown. You may have to do this in a couple batches. This step is optional if you want to get a crispier chicken.\n\nGarlic Sauce:\nAdd all the ingredients to a blender and blend until smooth, about 1-2 minutes. Refrigerate leftover sauce.\n\nChicken Shawarma Wraps:\nTo assemble the chicken shawarma wraps, warm up the pitas for 20 seconds to soften them. Spread a tbsp each of garlic sauce and hummus over the middle of the pita. Top with chicken, greek salad, garnish with parsley, and more sauce if desired.",
    "notes": "Note: In the video I forgot to add the onion to the marinade, so we ended up caramelizing some onion in some of the liquid left in the instant pot after the chicken was done.\n\nChicken breast can also be used instead of the thighs with the same cooking time.",

    "ingredients": "1 1/4 pounds center-cut salmon fillet, skin and pin bones removed\n2 tablespoons dijon mustard\n1 tablespoon mayonnaise\n1 tablespoon lemon juice\n1/2 teaspoon grated lemon zest\nPinch of cayenne pepper\n2 scallions, chopped\n1 cup plus 2 tablespoons panko (Japanese breadcrumbs)\nKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper\n2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing\n4 brioche buns, split\nTartar sauce and arugula, for topping",
    "directions": "Cut three-quarters of the salmon into 1/4-inch pieces. Put in a large bowl. Cut the rest of the salmon into chunks; transfer the chunks to a food processor along with the mustard, mayonnaise, lemon juice, lemon zest and cayenne. Pulse to make a paste. Add the pureed salmon mixture to the bowl with the diced salmon. Add the scallions, 2 tablespoons panko, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and black pepper to taste. Gently mix until just combined.\n\nLine a baking sheet with parchment paper and brush with olive oil. Divide the salmon mixture into 4 mounds on the parchment paper. With damp hands, pat into 4-inch-wide, 3/4-inch-thick patties. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes.\n\nPreheat the broiler. Spread the remaining 1 cup panko on a plate. Press both sides of the salmon patties in the panko. Heat the olive oil in a large nonstick or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the patties (in batches if necessary) and cook until browned on the bottom, 3 to 4 minutes, adjusting the heat if necessary. Turn and cook until the other side is browned and the patties feel springy in the center, 3 to 4 more minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain; season with salt.\n\nMeanwhile, arrange the buns, cut-side up, on a broiler pan and broil until toasted, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve the patties on the buns; top with tartar sauce and arugula.",

    "name": "Drop Biscuit Recipe (No Milk)",
    "ingredients": "2 1/4 cups (293 g) all purpose flour\n1 Tablespoon baking powder\n1 teaspoon salt\n1 cup cold water\n1 Tablespoon honey\n1 Tablespoon white vinegar\n1 stick unsalted butter chilled in freezer for 30 minutes \u2013 1 hour and grated\n\nOptional Add-ins & Topping:\n1/2 teaspoon garlic powder\n3/4 cup cheddar cheese\n1/4 cup chives\n\nHoney Butter:\n1 Tablespoon Honey\n2 Tablespoons unsalted butter melted",
    "directions": "Preheat the oven to 425\u00b0. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nIn a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt.\nIn a separate bowl, whisk together the water, honey, and vinegar.\nAdd the butter to the dry ingredients and stir until well combined.\nPour about half of the water mixture over the butter and dry ingredients. Stir gently.\nAdd the rest of the water mixture. Continue stirring just until the dough comes together.\nDrop about 2 heaping Tablespoons of dough onto the baking sheet to form about 15 biscuits.\nBake for 16-18 minutes or until the tops begin to turn golden brown. Brush with additional melted butter or honey butter before serving.",
    "notes": "Honey: Swap honey for 1 Tablespoon of white or brown sugar.\n\nWhite Vinegar: Swap for lemon juice or omit. However, it does add more depth to the flavor, mimicking the tang of buttermilk.\n\nGrated Butter: After the butter has chilled, use a box or hand grater to grate the butter. I do half of the butter with the finer blade and half with the larger blade creating a variety of sizes.\n\nHoney Butter: Simply mix the melted butter and honey together in a small bowl. Brush over the top of the warm biscuits.\n\nWork quickly. You want the butter and water to stay as cold as possible so the biscuits come out super fluffy. These are drop biscuits so do not spend too much time forming them. You can see in the photo above that mine are not super uniform.\n\nDon't over mix! Once the biscuit dough comes together, stop mixing.\n\nWhile you prepare the other ingredients, leave the grated butter in the freezer, so it stays cold.\n\nThe mixture will be sticky. If the mixture seems extremely wet, add another tablespoon of flour.\n\nDon't over bake! Once the tops just start to brown, remove them from the oven.",
